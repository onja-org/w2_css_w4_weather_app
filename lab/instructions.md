# 🌦️ Weather App Lab - Step-by-Step Instructions

> **Before starting**: Make sure you've read the main project README for an overview of what you'll be building.

## 📋 Lab Setup

You'll be working with these files:
- `index.html` ← **You will create this**
- `style.css` ← **Your main focus**
- `weatherData.js` ← **Do not edit** (handles weather data)
- `app.js` ← **Do not edit** (handles app functionality)
- `tests/weather-app.test.js` ← **Do not edit** (testing utilities)

## 🎯 Objective
In this lab, you will build a small weather app using **your own HTML** and style it with **pure CSS**. You will be given a working JavaScript file that handles data—you won’t touch that. Your goal is to create the structure with HTML and make it beautiful with CSS.

## 📁 Starter Files
You will receive the following files:

```
lab/
├── index.html        ← You will write this
├── weatherData.js    ← Do not edit
├── app.js            ← Do not edit
└── style.css         ← Your focus for this lab
```

> ✅ You will write `index.html` and style it in `style.css`.

## 🧱 Step 1: Create the HTML Structure

Build the following structure in `index.html`:

- A page title (`<h1>Weather App</h1>`) inside a `<header>` tag
- A `.dropdown` wrapper `<div>` containing the input and the suggestions list — `app.js` uses this wrapper to detect clicks outside the dropdown, so it must exist with exactly this class name
- An input field to type the city name (`<input type="text" id="cityInput">`) inside that wrapper
- A button to get the weather (`<button id="getWeather">Get Weather</button>`)
- A suggestions list **with `id="suggestions"`** (not a class) under the input — `app.js` looks it up by ID
- A container to display the weather info (`<section id="weatherInfo"></section>`)
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible: `<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`

`app.js` already contains two functions for you — `filterCities()` (drives the dropdown) and `getWeather()` (fetches and renders the result) — but nothing calls them until your HTML wires them up. Attach them with `oninput` and `onclick`:

Example layout (structure only):
```html
<header>
  <h1>Weather App</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <div class="dropdown">
    <input type="text" id="cityInput" placeholder="Start typing a city..." oninput="filterCities()">
    <button id="getWeather" onclick="getWeather()">Get Weather</button>
    <ul id="suggestions"></ul>
  </div>
  <section id="weatherInfo"></section>
</main>
```

> ⚠️ **Common mistake**: if you skip the `.dropdown` wrapper, `app.js`'s outside-click handler will throw an error on *every* click anywhere on the page. If you use `class="suggestions"` instead of `id="suggestions"`, or forget the `oninput`/`onclick` attributes, the tests can still pass but the app won't actually respond when you type or click — always click around in the browser to confirm it works, don't rely on `npm test` alone.

## 🎨 Step 2: Style the Page with CSS

Make the app visually appealing:

- Set a full-page background color or background image
- Use a modern, readable font
- Center the main content vertically and horizontally

> ✨ Bonus: You might have to use **flexbox or grid** to position major elements!

## 🖼️ Step 3: Style the Input and Button

- Give input and button uniform height
- Add internal padding and border-radius
- Add a hover/active style for the button
- Ensure good color contrast for accessibility
- Input should stretch to take up available space on wide screens

## 📜 Step 4: Dropdown Styling

The dropdown appears **dynamically** under the input when users type:

- Style the suggestions list to look like a popup menu
- Use spacing, colors, and hover states to make items interactive
- Prevent list from overlapping weirdly on small screens

## 📦 Step 5: Weather Info Box

Style the weather output so it looks like a **weather card**:

- Use shadows, border-radius, and light colors
- Display icon, temperature, and weather description clearly
- Use **flexbox** or **grid** for layout inside the card
- Optional: change background or accent color depending on the weather type

## ✅ Final Touches

- Use transitions for buttons and hover states
- Make the input field look interactive
- Test across multiple screen sizes
- Clean up any overlapping or scroll issues

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

To verify your work meets the requirements, run the automated tests:

```bash
# From the lab/ directory
npm install
npm test
```

The tests will validate:
- ✅ HTML structure and semantic elements
- ✅ Required CSS classes and styling
- ✅ Responsive layout implementation
- ✅ Interactive element styling

> **Tip**: Run tests frequently as you work through each step to catch issues early!

## 🚀 Submission

When you're done:
1. Save all changes to `index.html` and `style.css`
2. Ensure your HTML is semantic and valid
3. Test your app functionality with the provided JavaScript
4. From the project root, run `bash submit.sh` to submit your work

## 🌟 Stretch Goals (Optional)

- Add CSS animations (e.g. fade in weather card)
- Create a custom weather icon style
- Make the UI themeable (light/dark mode)
- Add a footer with credits and link to your GitHub
- Implement additional responsive breakpoints

💡 **Remember**: Don't worry if it doesn't look exactly like the reference image. The goal is to practice layout and styling techniques while creating a functional, beautiful interface.
